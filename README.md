# query-demo

This is a basic demo built to showcase how TanStack's React Query is used. Additional tools used in this project include:

- Zod: For schema validation
- React Hook Form: To handle forms
- Tailwind CSS (via the `shadCn`): For the UI

## Installation

First, ensure you're using the correct Node.js version:

```bash
  nvm use v21.6.2

```bash
    node server.js
```

### Frontend

The frontend is located in the frontend folder. To start the frontend development server, navigate to the frontend folder and run:
